# The-Shortcut-Project

This is a project where I document shortcuts for easy reference when need be, such as when switching development tools. 

This isn't a complete reference of shortcuts. Also some shortcuts may be provided for one tool but not yet for another (in pages offering more than one tool).

For a **favicon** using [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/); [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18156240/use-font-awesome-icon-as-favicon/28427373) are a few font-awesome favicon generators.
